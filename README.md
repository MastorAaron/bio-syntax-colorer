bio-syntax-colorer
This is to remedy the global pollution of other Syntax coloring or highlighting programs from the VSC Extension marketplace and allow for a Unique color per letter in FASTA, FASTQ and other biology related file types in the near future.

This is aimed to color each Nucleotide and Amino Acid uniquely in a FASTA or FASTQ file to make viewing more robust and at a glance, since GC islands are important biologically, along with other islands like long AAAA tails, etc.
